###4.4 Heights of adults. Researchers studying anthropometry collected body girth measurements
###and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and gender, for 507 physically
###active individuals. The histogram below shows the sample distribution of heights in centimeters.

(a) The mean is 171.1, and the median is 170.3
(b) The point estimate for the standard deviation is 9.4, and the IQR is 7.5
(c) Is a person who is 1m 80cm (180 cm) tall considered unusually tall? And is a person who is
1m 55cm (155cm) considered unusually short? Explain your reasoning.
